# Monte Carlo Simulation for Option Pricing

## Context: What Is a Monte Carlo Simulation?
 
A Monte Carlo simulation is a computational technique used to model the probability of different outcomes in systems or processes that are complex and involve random variables. This method is extensively used in fields such as finance, physics, engineering, and business to assess risk and uncertainty. It enables analysts to see all the possible outcomes of their decisions and assess the impact of risk, allowing for better decision-making under uncertainty.

## Project Objective

This project aims to apply the Monte Carlo simulation technique to the specific field of financial engineering for option pricing. The goal is to develop a simulation that can predict the pricing of options under various market conditions, accounting for factors like stock price volatility, interest rates, and time to expiration. This simulation will help in understanding how different scenarios affect the pricing of options, providing a valuable tool for traders and financial analysts.
